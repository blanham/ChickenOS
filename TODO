ChickenOS TODO
===============================================================================

Core
===============================================================================
-Improve quality of comments and commit messages
-Need to implement synchronization primitives - In Progress
	-Can use gcc/clang provided test and set primitives
-Add proper Virtual address management - In Progress
	-Add copy on write
	-Memory mapped files
-Build a testing infrastructure
	-probably start with fs first (well defined i/o API)
	-some parts will have to be built in
		-maybe scriptable w/ Lua?
-Use tables of function pointers for device drivers, tests and other things
 http://linuxgazette.net/157/amurray.html
-Port to ARM
	-Requires major refactoring and restructuring of the build process 
	-need to be able to easily change PHYS_BASE (3GB for i386, 2GB for arm32)
	-paging info:

-General fix of build process
-Restructure some things to use weak functions:
	-http://www.valvers.com/programming/c/gcc-weak-function-attributes

Console
===============================================================================
-Modify the kernel's printf to output info separately from tty0
	-printf ->stderr probably
	-kprintf ->fb console, serial
-Improve keyboard support
-Actually queue keycodes
-Implement line disciplines (raw and cooked mode) - In Progress
-Proper blocking I/O - In Progress
-Take stb_ttf and write a small app that takes a TTF font and generates
 either a bitmap or a c header
-Proper serial support, separate back end from character i/o - Done?
	-necesary for ARM

Threads
===============================================================================
-Implement passing open files to child threads - Done
-Implement wait queue
-May have to change/rewrite the scheduler
-Start factoring out platform specific code
	-Thread setup, fork, syscall_handler, and exec/load_elf are the main ones 
	 left
-TLS: http://www.airs.com/blog/archives/44

Userspace
===============================================================================
-Get dash working properly
	-Worked for a bit, either signals, waiting, or both are fragile
-Port coreutils or busybox
	-Done
-Port binutils/gcc/nasm
	-Have nasm and gcc binaries
-Port vim
	-Running, input is broken
-Port links/lynx
-Implement dynamic loading of libraries
	-Just have to implement stuff for the musl ldso to work

Syscalls
===============================================================================
-poll()
-select()
-termios stuff
-various fs calls
-GCC:
	wait4 - in progress
	read - done
	write - done
	open - done
	close - done
	stat - done
	fstat - done
	lstat - done
	lseek - done
	mmap - in progress
	mprotect
	munmap
	brk - done
	rt_sigaction - in progress
	ioctl - in progress?
	access - done?
	dup2 
	getpid - done
	vfork - sorta done, fork works,
	execve - done, could use improving
	fcntl
	unlink - in progress
	readlink - in progress
	chmod - in progress
	umask
	getrlimit 
	getrusage
	arch_prctl
	setrlimit

Network
===============================================================================
-Rewrite in progress
-Implement local sockets
-Try to figure out why we crash Virtualbox (and the host system) using the
 AM7990 driver
-Add NE9000 driver
-Add Intel 2200BG WiFi driver (can probably port iwi from openbsd or linux) 
 (if I do this, abstract out all system specific calls, so other osdev people
 can use the driver)
 and then port wpa_supplicant 
 (trivial: http://hostap.epitest.fi/wpa_supplicant/devel/porting.html) 
-Use dropbear for remote access

Filesystem
===============================================================================
-Implement ext2 write support - actually done, just needs new/extensible 
 file/directory support -in progress
-Implement fat12/16/32 support - in progress
-Need to add support for select()
-Maybe implement ISO9660 support for reading CDs
-Add a block cache (can likely use pintos code for reference) -in progress
-Continue work on the network filesystem, and maybe add NFS support
-Compartmentalize VFS, filesystems, block cache, and disk i/o from each other

Sound
===============================================================================
-Implement Soundblaster 16 support
-AC97 support may not be that hard to implement
-Goal is to be able to listen to one thing at a time

Video
===============================================================================
-Somehow get VBE/VESA to work so we can have something better than a simple 80
 column terminal (partially done)
-Get linear framebuffer to work so we can do video (partially done)
-get X11 working (EXTREMELY AMBITIOUS?)
-port SDL (has been done by other hobbiest OSes)
