This is the most elegant doubly linked list implementation
I have ever seen in C. For those who fret about C not having
a good list data structure, fret no more. The list is stolen
from Linux kernel. I just removed hardware prefetching from
the source code so that we can use it for user-space apps.

For sample code, see the hash table that I implemented using
this list.
